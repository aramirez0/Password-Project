# Password-Project
This project is a password generator using code from HTML, CSS, and JS. The JS was the only part that needed changing so I added and removed what code I felt was necessary until I could get it to work somewhat properly. I'll admit I had a hard time doing it, I couldn't get it to let me do 8<128 characters, it would only do 8. However I'll take what I can get as long as it's generating random characters as it should. I used Google quite a bit, referred back to the lectures, and used Stack Overflow to reference some of the code. I used passwordLengthUser to define the password length requirements based on whatever the user chose. If the user chose a number less than 8, it would notify them. If the user chose a number greater than 128, it would notify them.
